"""Render a .drawio through the draw.io desktop CLI.

draw.io is an Electron app that doubles as its own CLI, which brings a specific set of
traps, all of which this module works around:

  - The Windows portable build silently ignores CLI arguments. Only the installed build
    processes them, so the executable is located rather than assumed.
  - `--page-index` has an inconsistently documented base and open bugs where it exports
    a range rather than one page. Layers are addressed instead, by name, resolved to
    document-order indexes from the file itself.
  - The accepted flags change between releases. Version 29.7 dropped `--disable-update`
    and `--timeout`, both of which older documentation still lists. An unknown flag is
    not ignored: argument parsing breaks and the error reads "input file/directory not
    found", which blames the file. So the build is probed once via its own --help and
    only supported flags are passed.
  - PNG export has been reported to hang where SVG succeeds, so SVG is the default and
    the subprocess is always bounded by a timeout on this side.
  - Exit codes are coarse and at least one release prints "Export Failed" on success,
    so success is asserted on the output file existing and being non-empty.
